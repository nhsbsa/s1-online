<p>Thank you for your application for an S1 form.</p>
<p>We need you to send us some evidence so we can process your application.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Your UK State Pension start date.</h2>
<p>When you apply for an S1, there is an automatic check to the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to confirm the date your UK State Pension started.</p>
<p>This check was not able to confirm your UK State Pension start date.</p>
<p>We need you to send us a letter from the DWP that shows the exact date your pension was first paid.</p>
<p>If the DWP cannot give you a letter with this information, you can ask them to send us an email notification called a HINT. This will give us the pension details we need. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-work-pensions" target="_blank">Find out how to contact the DWP on the GOV.UK website</a>.</p>
<p>If you know when the DWP sent us a HINT, tell us and we will look for it.</p>

<h2 class="nhsuk-heading-m">Sending your evidence</h2>
<p>You can send us your evidence by taking a photo of it with a mobile phone or digital camera, or by scanning it.</p>

{{ insetText({
  "HTML": "<p>Send us your evidence online at <a href=\"../upload/start-page\" title=\"External website\">https://services.nhsbsa.nhs.uk/cra/upload</a>.</p>"
}) }}
<p>If you cannot send your evidence this way, let us know by email at <a href="mailto:">S1applications@nhsbsa.nhs.uk</a>.  </p>
<p>We cannot process your application until we get this evidence.</p>
