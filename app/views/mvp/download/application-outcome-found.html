    <p>You can download a copy of your S1 certificate and a covering letter as a PDF document.</p>
    <p>This may open in a new window, a new tab, or save to your downloads folder, depending on the browser or device you're using.</p>
    <a href="#">Download your S1 certificate and covering letter (PDF, 101KB).</a>

    <h3>What happens next</h3>
    <p>Your covering letter will give you more information about your S1, as well as any next steps you may need to take.</p>
    <p>You may need to print a copy of this if you need to show it to local authorities. If you do, we recommend using a colour printer.</p>
